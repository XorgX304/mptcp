Before evaluating the performance of Multipath TCP on wireless links, we
explored whether the nature of wireless permits transmitting
concurrently across multiple wireless links at all. In particular, we wanted
to determine:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Are there any inherent performance penalties when transmitting on two
    interfaces concurrently?
  \item Can any performance benefit be gained when transmitting on two
    interfaces concurrently?
  \item To what degree is the downlink performance affected by multiple clients
    using different networks simultaneously?
\end{enumerate}

To answer these questions, we ran several experiments using UDP and TCP New 
Reno.
The channel frequencies of the two networks were varied between experiments. One
network was set to channel 1 in the 2.4 GHz band, whilst the other
was switched between channel 1 for same-channel tests, channel 5 or 11 for
non-overlapping channel tests and a channel in the 5 GHz band for the dual band 
test. 

\subsubsection{Interference between 2.4 GHz channels}

\begin{figure}[h]

 \input{graphs/mp-int-2.4-ni.tex}
 \caption{Non-overlapping channel interference (channels 1 and 11)}\label{graph:cc-interference}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{graph:cc-interference} shows a UDP test as described in 
\S\ref{sec:met:setups:intudp}.
The interference pattern observed here is quite interesting, as the
utilization measurements show completely fair sharing of transmit time
between the two networks when both interfaces are active. The
wireless cards also report very few 802.11 retransmit failures.

As the two networks are operating at opposite ends of the 2.4 GHz spectrum, we
would expect both interfaces to transmit without colliding,
and the aggregate throughput to reach approximately the sum of the capacity of
both links. The reason why this behaviour is expected is that as the networks are non-overlapping, they should not interfere with each other, and
should be capable of transmitting concurrently. However, this perfect split of
utilisation between the two networks implies that carrier sense is being used between the interfaces.
Looking at the sum throughput, it is clear that although some performance gain is
achieved, the aggregate throughput is closer to 150\% of that of a single
interface than the 200\% one would expect from completely independent channels.

\begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
 \input{graphs/mp-int-2.4-i.tex}
 \caption{Same-channel interference}\label{graph:sc-interference}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{graph:sc-interference} shows a similar test performed with both
networks operating on the same channel in the 2.4 GHz band. The results here are
perhaps even more surprising, as carrier sense should enforce fairly strict
time multiplexing between two networks on the same channel. We would therefore
expect the total throughput to remain unaffected, regardless of
whether one or two interfaces are active. However, these results show that the
\textbf{total} throughput decreases to almost 60\% of that of a single link when
both interfaces are active.

In both of the cases above, it seems as though carrier sense is not working quite
as anticipated. We would generally expect few back-offs due to carrier sense between
networks on non-overlapping channels, but clearly this is not the case; carrier sense is causing a significant number of back-offs, which shows that the non-overlapping channels are experiencing significant interference.
Conversely, for networks on the same channel, we would expect carrier sense to
time-multiplex fairly between the clients. Here, however, the tests show a high number of 
link layer transmit failures, suggesting that carrier sense is often failing 
to prevent collisions.
% How many? Need to quantify this? J

These results lead us to believe that using multiple wireless networks on the same 2.4 GHz channel may in fact lead to a performance penalty, as compared to using only a
single interface. In the case where the networks are operating on non-overlapping 2.4
GHz channels, a performance benefit seems possible, although the gain may be less
than one would reasonably expect.

\subsubsection{Interference between bands}

   \input{graphs/interference-5-2.4-down.tex}\label{graph:cb-interference-down}
 }
 \caption{Cross-band interference}
\end{figure}

As expected, the experiments we performed with one network operating on the 2.4
GHz band and one network on the 5 GHz band showed no interference between
the networks.  Figure~\ref{graph:cb-interference-up} shows the CDF of the
throughputs for an uplink test with three of the tests described in 
\S\ref{sec:met:setups:seqtcp}, namely the parallel test and the two single interface tests.
 We see that the throughput in both cases is almost identical,
implying that the networks on these two bands are indeed 
operating independently. The throughput of the 2.4 GHz parallel test is 
marginally lower than in the single test, but we attribute this to the tests 
not being run at the same time. Other tests using the same setup show the 2.4 
GHz parallel throughput to be equal to that of the single on balance.

% A test at the same time would be nice?

Figure~\ref{graph:cb-interference-down} shows a similar test, but
run on the downlink. The same lack of interference between the interfaces
is evident, with the throughput of one interface being unrelated to whether the
other band is in use. This graph also shows a case where the 2.4 GHz
parallel is in fact performing better than its single counterpart. As mentioned
above, we put this down to varying background traffic on other networks
between the times of the two tests.

These results indicate that there should be no performance penalty to using
multiple networks on different bands simultaneously. In fact, in the best case,
the total throughput should be the sum of each links' capacity.
