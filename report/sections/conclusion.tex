In this paper we have presented a number of wireless experiments showing that
multiplexing across multiple wireless interfaces on a single host may indeed
provide advantages over single interface hosts for certain network
configurations both in terms of reliability and throughput.

Further, we have shown that Multipath TCP works quite well when traffic is
primarily downlink, as is often the case on wireless networks today, as traffic
is balanced between the available wireless networks and each host only uses a
fair share of the total network capacity. We have also shown that Multipath TCP
does not behave correctly for connections with mostly uplink traffic due to a
combination of 802.11 retransmissions and effectively unbounded buffering in the
network stack.

Finally, we have discussed how the uplink problems experienced by Multipath TCP
are not unique to wireless links, and that they manifest also for vanilla TCP
connections as bloated buffers. Unfortunately, we have not been able to test our
suggestion for a solution to this problem, and so the question of how to
properly limit queue sizes without the presence of loss remains an open problem.

Due to the widespread deployment and high diversity in wireless networks, there
are many potentially interesting experiments we have not been able to do due to
time constraints. First and foremost, all of our experiments were performed in
a building where several other wireless networks were present, making it
difficult to obtain consistent results. To verify the behaviour we have
observed, repeating the experiments in more controlled environments may be a
sound next step.

Most of our experiments were also conducted with only two, static APs, two or
three wireless clients each with a maximum of two interfaces. Investigating how
Multipath TCP behaves when more networks are available, or how it behaves with
different positioning of the APs may yield significantly differing results. As
5~GHz networks become more prevalent, testing the amount of interference between
5~GHz channels could also be of value.

The interference patterns we observed in \S\ref{sec:results-interference} also
suggest that some further research on how Carrier Sense works across channels
could be warranted.

% Notes from our meeting with Mark about the report:
% - Important: Conclusions - how well does MPTCP works, when does it
%   work/doesn't work, why, and what could be done to improve it (it's all about
%   the conclusions)
% - The main goal of our project is to suggest whether or not MPTCP should be
%   improved, and if so, conceptually what could be done to improve it. We
%   should also mention what would we do next if the project continued.
