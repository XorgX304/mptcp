Before discussing Multipath TCP with Coupled congestion control, we present
results using Multipath TCP with New Reno congestion control operating
independently for each subflow. This congestion control algorithm allows the
congestion window of each subflow to grow as if it were an independent TCP flow,
and is known to use an unfair share of the total available bandwidth\footnote{RFC 6356 - Coupled Congestion Control for Multipath Transport Protocols.}. These
results may seem unnecessary, but we believe it is useful to show
the subtle difference between running two wireless clients in parallel and one
client with multiple wireless interfaces. Using New Reno allows us to evaluate this separately from the load balancing performed by the Coupled algorithm.

On the downlink, we would expect each Multipath TCP subflow to have an equal
share of the total throughput as a regular TCP flow, as there should be no
difference in interference when running both WiFi interfaces on the same machine
compared to on separate machines when each interface is only transmitting ACKs.
This can be seen in \subref{graph:sc-reno-down} through
\subref{graph:cb-reno-down} in Figure~\ref{graph:reno-down}. Again, we attribute
the discrepancies in \subref{graph:cc-reno-down} to the unstable nature of
wireless networks.

The per-subflow fairness in the downlink case is achieved in two steps. Firstly,
the wireless medium should be shared equally between the two APs (assuming they
both have data to send and their channels are equally busy) due to carrier
sense. Additionally, because TCP New Reno does not try to balance the load on
each flow, the sender would continuously try to push as much data as it can get
on the link and this is only limited by the finite buffer at the AP. The effect
of this is that the APs drop further incoming packets as soon as their buffers are full, and this notifies the sender to adapt its rate. However, this does not mean that TCP New Reno would reduce its aggressiveness, it just reduces the amount of packets it has in flight at a given time. This value still grows as aggressively as before hence the buffers at the AP are always full. The full buffers ensure
that the AP's always have data to send on behalf of each flow when it gets its
fair share of the medium as determined by carrier sense. Hence this should lead
to the flows sharing the available bandwidth fairly as they have roughly the
same amount of access to the medium. 
Although, the flows have a fair share of the bandwidth this does not mean TCP New Reno is fair, in fact it is not. As previously explained, this fairness is achieved due to the AP buffers overflowing; this causes the sender to adapt its rate but, TCP New Reno maintains its aggressiveness. In reality, if the AP buffers did not overflow and hence limited the amount of packets in flight, TCP New Reno would continue to grow aggressively and cause its flows to have different amounts of access to the medium. This would lead a flow to take more than its fair share of the bandwidth, displaying then an unfair behaviour.  

\subsubsection{Uplink}
\label{sec:results-mptcp-up}

\begin{figure}[h]

  \subfloat[][2.4 GHz, same channel] {\
    \scalebox{0.70}{\input{graphs/sc-reno-up.tex}}\label{graph:sc-reno-up}

  }
  \caption{Uplink, New Reno}\label{graph:reno-up}
\end{figure}

Due to the unpredictable nature of wireless and varying levels of background
traffic, obtaining consistent results for these tests was a time consuming
process. The general trend we observe in Figure~\ref{graph:reno-up} is the
same seen on the downlink; each Multipath TCP subflow gets an equal
share of the total throughput to every other flow on that link. This also makes
sense conceptually; on the uplink, the 802.11 MAC provides fairness
\textbf{per 802.11 station} using carrier sense as explained in
\S\ref{sec:bg:wifi}. On the downlink fairness is provided by carrier sense
\textbf{and} the APs. Since Multipath TCP acts as one station on each network,
we would expect each subflow to get half the available capacity on each network
when using New Reno.

The equal distribution above gives Multipath TCP an aggregate throughput equal
to the sum of half of each links' capacity, and suggests that no additional interference
penalty is incurred by running both interfaces on the same client rather than on
different clients. We can also reason from this that Multipath TCP with Coupled
congestion control should theoretically be able to eventually reach the same
throughput as parallel clients if no other flows are competing on the network; 
this will be examined at in \S\ref{sec:results-performance}.
